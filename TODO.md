# TODO for 2D N-Body Particle Simulation

- [x] Create constants.py with simulation constants
- [x] Create particle.py with Particle class
- [x] Create quadtree.py with Quadtree implementation
- [x] Create physics.py with force calculations and collision handling
- [x] Create gui.py with GUI elements (buttons, sliders)
- [x] Create main.py with main loop, rendering, input handling
- [x] Run main.py and test basic functionality
- [x] Optimize for larger particle counts (Barnes-Hut, quadtree)
- [x] Verify physics accuracy and performance
